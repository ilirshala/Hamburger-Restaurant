          Our potatoes come fresh from the most awesome places in Idaho. We only
          use the best possible oils to fry them in. No soggy flimsy fires here,
          we serve only the best. Crisp golden fries combined with our special
          seasoning and salt. Fries are standard with every order, and if you
          didn’t get your fill there, we also have the best boiled peanuts in
          the world. Yes we said world.
